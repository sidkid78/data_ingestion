# System Architecture

## Overview
The document management system is built using a modern, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system consists of a FastAPI backend, React/Next.js frontend, and utilizes PostgreSQL and Neo4j for data storage.

## Components

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **UI Layer**: Built with React 18 and Next.js 14
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for robust type checking
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for high-performance async endpoints
- **Data Processing**: Asynchronous document ingestion and processing
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (future implementation)
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL**
  - Document metadata
  - Full-text search capabilities
  - Audit logs
  - User data (future implementation)

- **Neo4j**
  - Document relationships
  - Graph-based queries
  - Knowledge graph representation
  - Policy compliance tracking

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**
   - Federal Register documents
   - FAR/DFARS regulations
   - Standards and specifications

2. **Processing**
   - Text extraction
   - Metadata enrichment
   - Relationship identification
   - Policy validation

3. **Storage**
   - Document storage in PostgreSQL
   - Relationship storage in Neo4j
   - Versioning and audit trails

### Integration Points
- **Azure Storage**: Document blob storage
- **Redis**: Caching and rate limiting
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task processing

## System Flow
1. User submits document or query through frontend
2. Request validated by FastAPI backend
3. Document processed through ingestion pipeline
4. Data stored in appropriate databases
5. Results returned to frontend
6. Real-time updates via WebSocket (future implementation)

## Security Considerations
- Input validation at all entry points
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure credential storage
- CORS configuration
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting
- Health check endpoints

## Future Enhancements
- Elasticsearch integration for advanced search
- Machine learning for document classification
- Real-time collaboration features
- Automated policy compliance checking
