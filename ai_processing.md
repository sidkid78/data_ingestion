# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Title:**

AI Processing Component for the 4D AI-Driven Knowledge Framework

## 1. Overview

The AI Processing Component enables advanced reasoning, contextual data retrieval, compliance verification, and explainable AI (XAI) capabilities within the 4D AI-Driven Knowledge Framework. It leverages the Algorithm of Thought (AoT) workflow, AI personas, and compliance systems to provide accurate, ethical, and context-aware decision-making.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Goals

*   **Structured Decision-Making:** Implement the AoT workflow to ensure systematic reasoning and robust task prioritization.
*   **AI Personas:** Develop role-based AI personas to provide domain-specific insights tailored to user expertise.
*   **Compliance Assurance:** Deploy a dual AI system to validate regulatory and ethical compliance.
*   **Transparency and Explainability:** Integrate XAI modules to enhance trust in AI-driven decisions.

### 2.2 Objectives

*   Build modular components for query parsing, contextualization, and compliance checks.
*   Implement federated learning and secure multi-party computation for privacy-preserving AI.
*   Establish an iterative refinement process for resolving discrepancies in AI outputs.

**Key Principles**

*   Write concise, technical descriptions with accurate examples in Python for AI workflows and Neo4j integrations.
*   Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid excessive use of object-oriented designs.
*   Modularize AI processing components for scalability and reusability.
*   Use descriptive variable names, e.g., `query_input`, `persona_role`, `compliance_score`.
*   Follow naming conventions:
    *   Python files: lowercase with underscores, e.g., `ai_processing/query_parser.py`.
    *   Directory names: lowercase with dashes, e.g., `utils/persona-helpers`.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Algorithm of Thought (AoT) Workflow

**Stages:**

*   **Query Parsing:**
    *   Utilize advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT-4) to parse queries and extract intent.
    *   Decompose complex queries into sub-queries for targeted analysis.
*   **Contextual Mapping:**
    *   Identify the userâ€™s role, expertise, and query intent.
    *   Activate relevant AI personas for tailored analysis.
*   **Data Retrieval:**
    *   Use 4D coordinate mapping, semantic search, and knowledge graph traversal to gather relevant data.
    *   Employ federated learning for decentralized data analysis.
*   **Gap Analysis:**
    *   Detect missing information or inconsistencies within the retrieved data.
    *   Trigger query refinement or escalate unresolved conflicts for human review.
*   **Reasoning and Compliance:**
    *   Apply rule-based reasoning and probabilistic modeling for insights.
    *   Validate outputs against compliance standards using the Compliance AI.

### 3.2 AI Persona Management

*   **Persona Profiles:**
    *   Role-based profiles include certifications, decision heuristics, and access control levels.
    *   Embedded as structured metadata in YAML files, with 4D coordinate mapping.
*   **Contextual Adaptation:**
    *   Tailor responses based on persona attributes and user queries.
    *   Enable collaboration between personas for multifaceted queries.

### 3.3 Compliance and Ethical Validation

*   **Compliance AI:**
    *   Runs parallel to the primary AI to validate adherence to regulations and ethical principles.
    *   Employs consensus mechanisms to resolve discrepancies between AI models.
*   **Ethical Oversight:**
    *   Implements bias detection metrics and fairness constraints during model training.
    *   Escalates ethical dilemmas to a human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow.

### 3.4 Explainable AI (XAI)

*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Generate rationale and traceability for AI decisions using natural language generation (NLG).
    *   Provide confidence scores and counterfactual explanations for key outputs.
    *   Visualize AI reasoning pathways with decision trees and Sankey diagrams.

## 4. Code Style and Structure

**Backend (Python for AI Processing):**

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async def` for API calls and I/O tasks.
*   **Type Hints:** Use Python type hints (`Dict`, `List`, `Optional`) for function signatures.
*   **File Structure:**
    *   `routers/`: API routes.
    *   `personas/`: Persona management.
    *   `xai/`: Explainable AI tools.
    *   `compliance/`: Compliance and validation logic.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement retry mechanisms for API and database operations.
    *   Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring.

**Frontend (React/TypeScript for Dashboards):**

*   **TypeScript Interfaces:** Define interfaces for data payloads (e.g., persona metadata, query results).
*   **UI Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design and XAI dashboards.
*   **State Management:** Use lightweight solutions like Zustand for local state.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
